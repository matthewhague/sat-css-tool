# Note on pseudo classes

We support fully all CSS3 pseudo classes, as defined in the specification.
Additionally we support :valid and :invalid.
Selectors 
* -moz-any-link 
* :-moz-submit-invalid
* :-moz-ui-invalid
* :default
* :-webkit-full-screen
* :-moz-full-screen 
appear in the benchmarks.
They are not directly supported, but treated as simple booleans, which is sufficient.
